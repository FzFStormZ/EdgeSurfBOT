EdgeSurfBOT is a little project based on the game "surf" of the Edge browser.

## How works ‚ùî

First, my code based on the **High visibility mode** which allows seeing rectangles around each object on the game.
After that, I can know if the surfer going to an obstacle, a boost or anything in the game.
To detect objects, I build rectangles around the surfer to decide on what the surfer doing to what is in each rectangle:

In this game, we have a colour code which are:
* **Black objects**: They are dangerous for the surfer. They stop him and he loses 1 ‚ù§Ô∏è.
* **Red objects**: They aren't dangerous but slow down the surfer.
* **Green objects**: They allow to take a ‚ö° boost or a springboard in goal to gain a speed boost.


## Requirements

- Python 3
- New Microsoft Edge browser ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Dependencies

- PyAutoGui : <https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI>
- Numpy : <https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>

## Quick Start

1. Clone the latest version of Volatility from GitHub:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/FzFStormZ/EdgeSurfBOT.git
    ```

2. Go on your Edge browser and put this link below on your navigation bar:

    ```shell
    edge://surf
    ```

3. Choose the same settings than me:

    _Explain:_
    + **Let's surf** : Principal game mode
    + **High visibility mode** allows seeing rectangles around each object on the game
    + **Reduced speed mode** allows taking decision easier

4. ‚ö†Ô∏è __WARNING__ ‚ö†Ô∏è Split your screen between the browser and your CMD such as:

## Versions

**Last version :** 2.0
List of versions : [Click to show them](https://github.com/FzFStormZ/EdgeSurfBOT/tags)

## TO DO

* Detect red obstacles.
* Box to find quickly a boost (after 1000 meters).
* Fix the fact that the surfer doesn't continue after down by black object.
* Decisional conditions to machine learning (after a complete decisional conditions project).
